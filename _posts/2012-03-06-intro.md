This blog was created with jekyll, a static site generation tool created in ruby.  Jekyll caught my interest as a simple solution to creating a site with rarely updated content without relying on active page generation on the server side (i.e. static vs dynamic site).  By parsing templates through converters, it allows the user to add dynamic content to a static site by regenerating the pages manually then uploading to the server.  This means that while visitors won't get dynamic content, the actual delivery of the site is extremely straightforward and (theoretically) free from any vector of attack (nothing processed by the server).  After dealing with a few installations of vulnerable tools, I think something that can be created then left alone is ideal for this particular application.
