title: glitch update 1
---
The glitch project is based on an idea from my friend Lee Nielsen ([humanate](http://humanate.com "humanate")) to do an art project based on corrupting digital photo files.  Unfortunately, things took a fairly long time to sort out so a collaboration never materialized, but since he mentioned the idea, I was on the lookout for this concept, and a later blog post I came across detailed how it would work ([the social network soundtrack art](http://rob-sheridan.com/TSN/ "the social network")).  Finding the post also clued me into the term 'glitch', which lead to a lot more material on how people were creating a similar effect with a variety of file types.

In practical application, the simplest/fastest thing that worked was using a PSD file.  For whatever reason, the PSD file format seemed to be the least fragile when manipulating the raw data.

Manual editing of these files, however, can be quite tedious.  Due to the simplicity of the manipulation, I thought it would be interesting to write a program that would automate some random 'corruption' in a psd file.  The result is the .net glitch project, currently a commandline C# application that does some random transformations on a given psd file (<a href="https://github.com/ttorigai/glitch">glitch on github</a>).  Some example images are presented below.
