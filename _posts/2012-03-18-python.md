title: basic python script  
---
I recently completed the online google python class (not the videos, just went through the articles and the exercises) and found that the course materials perfectly covered what I required to download a set of failing hard drive noise samples listed at <a href="http://datacent.com/hard_drive_sounds.php">data cent</a>.  It was simple and fast to put together and I hope to pick up more basic scripting-style programming in the future (I'm not sure but I would assume that it would have been even easier to do this in other high level scripting languages or even a basic commandline command since it's really just text processing and url downloading).  Generally speaking, I'm still not comfortable or well-versed with linux/unix commands, so hopefully this will be a step in the right direction.

	import os
	import re
	import sys
	import urllib
	
	def get_mp3_list():
	  retval = []
	  url = 'http://datacent.com/hard_drive_sounds.php'
	  page = urllib.urlopen(url)
	  info = page.info()
	  if info.gettype() == 'text/html':
	    text = page.read()
	    matches = re.findall(r'file=(\w+.mp3)&', text)
	    for match in matches:
	      if not match in retval:
	        retval.append(match)
	  return retval
	
	def save_mp3s(mp3s):
	  urlprefix = 'http://datacent.com/getsound.php?file='
	  for mp3 in mp3s:
	    print 'Downloading ' + mp3
	    urllib.urlretrieve(urlprefix + mp3, os.path.join('samples',mp3))
	
	def main():
	  mp3s = get_mp3_list()
	  save_mp3s(mp3s)
	
	if __name__ == '__main__':
	  main()
