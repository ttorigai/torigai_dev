title: glitch update 3 
---
In this latest update, I added some more parameter configurability.  These were the simplest ones to add and took minimal effort but should allow a fair bit more flexibility in the final result.

Basic testing seems to indicate an ideal size to aim for is 1kb to 3kb for size limits, and about 3-4 passes.  These values will likely vary depending on the size of the source file, however.

The new version can be downloaded here: [Glitch_20120325.zip](/file/Glitch_20120325.zip)

This is a sample image produced with the last glitch release by Dave McQueen, a fellow instructor of my friend Lee at the [Guru Digital Arts College](http://gurudigitalarts.com).
