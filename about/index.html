	<p>torigai dev - a basic jekyll-generated blog to document various development efforts</p>
	<p>Basic personal profile: I mostly develop on the microsoft stack, primarily C# in visual studio.  I am currently working to expand my development abilities with more focus on different technologies (such as python or ruby) as well as attempting to put some personal projects done in .net online.  This site is another attempt to diversify and expand my web development experience.</p>
